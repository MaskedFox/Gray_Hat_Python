I will be posting  code from what i learn from the book Gray Hay Python
NOTE: the Windows debugger its currently for 32-bit Windows version and should be used with 32-bit Python.
On top of it the Windows debugger was created with working Python3, while i only have one folder for my code, check my commits as you can see all the different phases and if you are working through the book this can help you, also check my comments on the code for the different stages. Shoot me an email if you have any questions =)
